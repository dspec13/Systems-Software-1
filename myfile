Biology
Wartortle is a bipedal, indigo Pokémon similar to a turtle. It has brown eyes, a dark blue streak on each cheek, and two sharp teeth protruding from its upper jaw. It has three clawed fingers and pointed toes. Pale blue fur covers its long ears and tail. A brown shell with a pale yellow underside encases its body. A thick, white rim separates the upper and lower halves of the shell. As Wartortle grows old, its tail fur will darken, and it may have algae growing on its shell. The shell may also carry scars from past battles.

To maintain balance while swimming at high speeds, Wartortle moves its furry ears and tail. It can use the fur to store air for extended underwater diving. Its tail is a popular symbol of longevity, making it popular with the elderly. It hides in water when hunting and emerges to surprise its prey. In the past, Skull Bash was its signature move. The anime has shown that Wartortle can be found living in colonies on islands, but its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes.

Trivia

Anime promotional art depicting Wartortle with the same color on its ears and its face
Even though Wartortle's ears are depicted lighter than its face in the official Sugimori stock art and most of its game sprites, early promotional pictures portrayed its ears the same color as its face.
Origin
Its design appears to be a stylized turtle. Its feathery tail is a reference to Japanese legends of the minogame (蓑亀), a turtle which lived for 10,000 years and grew a tail made of seaweed. The use of its tail to store oxygen seems to be a reference to certain turtles that breathe through their cloaca, placed near the tail.

Name origin
Wartortle's name is a combination of war or warrior, tortoise, and turtle.

Kameil comes from the Japanese word 亀 kame (tortoise/turtle) and may be a combination of 亀 kame and テール tail. It is also a corruption of 噛める kameru (to be able to bite).
